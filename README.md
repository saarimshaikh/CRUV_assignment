# Advanced Cricket Tournament Simulation Program using Python

Two teams compete in a cricket competition that is simulated by this Python programme. The simulation uses player statistics, including batting, bowling, fielding, running, and experience, to calculate the likelihood that different match outcomes, including boundaries, wickets, and runs scored, will occur.

## Instructions

1. There is no need to install Python on your system to execute these files.
2. First go to google collab website here is the link of that https://colab.research.google.com/?utm_source=scs-index
3. Now you have to clone the repository using !git clone "respository link".
4. After this you have to run main.py file for that you can hit new line and write this command !python main.py
5. By running main.py you can now see the result.
6. I have also uploaded the screen recording of the assignment in this repository

   ```shell
   python main.py
